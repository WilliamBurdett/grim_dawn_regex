# grim_dawn_regex
The whole point of this is to help search for items on www.grimtools.com

## Usage
Right now it is just edit the file `generate_regex.py` with the values you want
### Fields to edit
* damage_types_list - list of damage types to search for
* convert_from_types_list - list of damage types to convert from
* classes_list - the classes you are using
* skills_list - the skills you are using

## TODO
So the skills and classes databases aren't finished, so you may need to add skills to it yourself
